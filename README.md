This repo contains example projects which are created for Introduction to Programming in Java Course.

**Topic of Project:**

* Generation of prime numbers no larger than n using the naïve method 
and the sieve of Erasthotenes and their execution times measurements. 
The naïve method, for given number x, checks whether any number 
from 2 up to the (x – 1) is a divisor of x.
